switching_select_energylevels.py
 File in which level splitting is manualy selected,
 mouse3 key selects a point, mouse2 shows interpolated curve.
 Selected (p,v) points are then saved to "lifetimes_params_processed" in .npy files. 

switching_processed_plot.py
 Selected (p,v) from "lifetimes_params_processed" are interpolated,
 data are then sorted in populations up and down.
 Plots are made for mean lifetimes, and all relevant sorted data are saved to .npy files.

lifetimes_energylevels
 Manualy selected datapoints

lifetimes
 Relevant parameters regarding state lifetimes.
